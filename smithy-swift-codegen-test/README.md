# smithy-swift-codegen-test

This portion of smithy-swift is preserved here for historical purposes.  The code in this subdirectory was used to bootstrap ourselves in early stages of development, and are keeping this here for an indeterminate amount of time.

To re-enable these tests add the following to the top-level `settings.gradle.kts` file:
```
include("smithy-swift-codegen-test")
```
